# Build Instructions

It's just a basic Create-React-App, so `yarn start` or `npm start` to run it.

# What Else I'd Liked to Have Done

- The shuffle function wasn't particularly "fair", so I would have liked to play with that a bit more, but I imagine that it would take a bit to get it right

- Making it look better would have been nice (maybe splitting up an image or doing jQuery transitions)

- Making shuffles a set of actions applied in one go probably would have been good (as opposed to setting the state heaps)

- I needed to put a full stop in the empty tile to stop a formatting glitch, so having it empty having that work would have been nice

- `App.js` has a lot of the logic, so maybe splitting that up a bit (maybe by using something like Redux) would have been nice too
